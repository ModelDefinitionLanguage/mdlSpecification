It is intended to be largely agnostic about the choice of target tool. MDL should facilitate clear and unambiguous definition of models, with information conveyed in a consistent manner to the PharmML representation and onwards to the target software specific code.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nMike K Smith (@MikeKSmith) is the lead user for MDL.\r\nStuart Moodie (@stumoodie) is the technical lead for MDL.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nIssues, bugs, feature requests, suggestions for MDL can be logged via the Issues page of this site. Email contact information will be added very soon.",
