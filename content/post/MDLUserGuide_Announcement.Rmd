The MDL User Guide and Reference Manual are now available online: 
https://modeldefinitionlanguage.github.io/MDLUserGuide/.  

There is a toolbar at the top of the manual that allows you to see the section
browser, search within the manual, change text attributes while reading, edit
a page (via Github) and download the manual as PDF or ePub (coming soon!).

The User Guide will
be maintained and updated on Github at 
https://github.com/ModelDefinitionLanguage/MDLUserGuide. We encourage the 
community to contribute to and update the manual either by editing .Rmd files
directly on Github or by making a copy of the repository, making changes 
and submitting a pull request, according to the 
[Github workflow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/). 

The User Guide is compiled using 
[RStudio's bookdown package](https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown). 
[Yihui Xie](https://yihui.name/) has provided 
[a comprehensive guide to bookdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/). 
By downloading bookdown and dependent packages, it is possible for anybody to
recompile the manual using R.
