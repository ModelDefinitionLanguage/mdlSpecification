## Welcome to the DDMoRe Model Description Language (MDL) Community page.
This website will provide a resource for anyone wishing to encode models with MDL, 
will help you understand MDL structure and features and provides a place for you 
to log bugs, issues, feature requests and suggestions.

### What is MDL?
MDL is a human writeable and human readable language designed to describe 
pharmacometric models. It is intended to be largely agnostic about the choice of
target tool. MDL should facilitate clear and unambiguous definition of models, 
with information conveyed in a consistent manner to the PharmML representation 
and onwards to the target software specific code.

### Where can I find details about writing models using MDL language and grammar?
The [MDL User Guide and Reference Manual](http://www.ddmore.eu/sites/ddmore/files/instructions/pdf/MDLUserGuide_1.1_PublicRelease_August2016_0.pdf)
is available online in PDF format. 

### What tools are available for writing and editing MDL?
An [MDL-Editor](http://downloads.mdl.community/repository/mdl-ide/products/1.7.0/) 
is available for download. This is a cross-platform, Eclipse-based Integrated 
Development Environment (IDE) for writing MDL models incorporating syntax 
highlighting and grammar checks. It is available for Windows (
[32bit](http://downloads.mdl.community/repository/mdl-ide/products/1.7.0/eu.ddmore.mdleditor.site-1.7.0-win32.win32.x86.zip) and 
[64bit](http://downloads.mdl.community/repository/mdl-ide/products/1.7.0/eu.ddmore.mdleditor.site-1.7.0-win32.win32.x86_64.zip)), 
Linux (
[32bit](http://downloads.mdl.community/repository/mdl-ide/products/1.7.0/eu.ddmore.mdleditor.site-1.7.0-linux.gtk.x86.zip) and 
[64bit](http://downloads.mdl.community/repository/mdl-ide/products/1.7.0/eu.ddmore.mdleditor.site-1.7.0-linux.gtk.x86_64.zip)) and Mac
[Mac OS](http://downloads.mdl.community/repository/mdl-ide/products/1.7.0/eu.ddmore.mdleditor.site-1.7.0-macosx.cocoa.x86_64.zip). Simply download the zip file and unzip to an appropriate location. 
An update site has been configured within Eclipse so that future updates to the 
MDL-Editor can be retrieved from within Eclipse without having to download 
another zip file. 

The MDL Editor can be used to develop models using MDL and to export these models
to PharmML, ready for upload to the DDMoRe repository: <http://repository.ddmore.eu>.

### But what if I want to run the models?
At the [ddmore.eu](http://ddmore.eu/instructions/user-guides)
website you'll also find instructions for downloading and installing the DDMoRe 
Interoperability Framework Standalone Execution Environment (SEE) demonstrator.
The SEE installers are available from [Sourceforge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/ddmore/files/install/SEE/Demonstrator-2.0.0/).
The SEE is a DDMoRe demonstration product which includes R, NONMEM, Monolix, 
BUGS, PFIM, PopED, simulx (from the `mlxR` R package). The SEE is only available 
for Windows at present.

### What resources are there to help me learn MDL and use the editor / SEE?
A [YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_GGUkhbiP3t0Q7wTqkQdMAw7yuC8xWa-) 
is available for videos detailing how to get started with the software.

A set of Use Case examples is provided with the SEE, which are also available on 
[SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/p/ddmore/use.cases/ci/master/tree/MDL/Product5.1/).

### What is coming on this website?
In the near future we hope to provide: 

* An online wiki format of the MDL User Guide and Reference Manual
* Answers to Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)
* An issues log for capturing bugs, feature requests and suggestions for MDL
* A walkthrough of the MDL Use Case examples explaining and annotating the code.
