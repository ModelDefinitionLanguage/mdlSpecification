<p>The MDL User Guide and Reference Manual are now available online: <a href="https://modeldefinitionlanguage.github.io/MDLUserGuide/" class="uri">https://modeldefinitionlanguage.github.io/MDLUserGuide/</a>.</p>
<p>There is a toolbar at the top of the manual that allows you to see the section browser, search within the manual, change text attributes while reading, edit a page (via Github) and download the manual as PDF or ePub (coming soon!).</p>
<p>The User Guide will be maintained and updated on Github at <a href="https://github.com/ModelDefinitionLanguage/MDLUserGuide" class="uri">https://github.com/ModelDefinitionLanguage/MDLUserGuide</a>. We encourage the community to contribute to and update the manual either by editing .Rmd files directly on Github or by making a copy of the repository, making changes and submitting a pull request, according to the <a href="https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/">Github workflow</a>.</p>
<p>The User Guide is compiled using <a href="https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown">RStudioâ€™s bookdown package</a>. <a href="https://yihui.name/">Yihui Xie</a> has provided <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/">a comprehensive guide to bookdown</a>. By downloading bookdown and dependent packages, it is possible for anybody to recompile the manual using R.</p>
