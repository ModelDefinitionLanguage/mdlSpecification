<div id="welcome-to-the-ddmore-model-description-language-mdl-community-page." class="section level2">
<h2>Welcome to the DDMoRe Model Description Language (MDL) Community page.</h2>
<p>This website will provide a resource for anyone wishing to encode models with MDL, will help you understand MDL structure and features and provides a place for you to log bugs, issues, feature requests and suggestions.</p>
<div id="what-is-mdl" class="section level3">
<h3>What is MDL?</h3>
<p>MDL is a human writeable and human readable language designed to describe pharmacometric models. It is intended to be largely agnostic about the choice of target tool. MDL should facilitate clear and unambiguous definition of models, with information conveyed in a consistent manner to the PharmML representation and onwards to the target software specific code.</p>

<div id="where-can-i-find-out-more-about-mdl" class="section level3">
<h3>Where can I find out more about MDL?</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://www.ddmore.eu/sites/ddmore/files/instructions/pdf/MDLUserGuide_1.1_PublicRelease_August2016_0.pdf">MDL User Guide and Reference Manual</a> is available online in PDF format.</p>
<p>At the <a href="http://ddmore.eu/instructions/user-guides">ddmore.eu</a> website you’ll also find instructions for downloading and installing the DDMoRe Interoperability Framework Standalone Execution Environment (SEE) demonstrator.</p>
<p>An <a href="http://downloads.mdl.community/repository/mdl-ide/products/1.6.0/">MDL-Editor</a> is available for download. This is a cross-platform, Eclipse-based Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for writing MDL models incorporating syntax highlighting and grammar checks. It is available for Windows ( <a href="http://downloads.mdl.community/repository/mdl-ide/products/1.6.0/eu.ddmore.mdleditor.site-1.6.0-SNAPSHOT-win32.win32.x86.zip">32bit</a> and <a href="http://downloads.mdl.community/repository/mdl-ide/products/1.6.0/eu.ddmore.mdleditor.site-1.6.0-SNAPSHOT-win32.win32.x86_64.zip">64bit</a>), <a href="http://downloads.mdl.community/repository/mdl-ide/products/1.6.0/eu.ddmore.mdleditor.site-1.6.0-SNAPSHOT-linux.gtk.x86_64.zip">Linux</a> and <a href="http://downloads.mdl.community/repository/mdl-ide/products/1.6.0/eu.ddmore.mdleditor.site-1.6.0-SNAPSHOT-macosx.cocoa.x86_64.zip">Mac OS</a>. Simply download the zip file and unzip to an appropriate location. An update site has been configured within Eclipse so that future updates to the MDL-Editor can be retrieved from within Eclipse without having to download another zip file.</p>
<p>The MDL Editor can be used to develop models using MDL and to export these models to PharmML, ready for upload to the DDMoRe repository: <a href="http://repository.ddmore.eu" class="uri">http://repository.ddmore.eu</a>.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_GGUkhbiP3t0Q7wTqkQdMAw7yuC8xWa-">YouTube playlist</a> is available for videos detailing how to get started with the software.</p>
<p>A set of Use Case examples is provided with the SEE, which are also available on <a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/ddmore/use.cases/ci/master/tree/MDL/Product5.1/">SourceForge</a>.</p>

<li>An online wiki format of the MDL User Guide and Reference Manual</li>
<li>Answers to Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</li>
<li>An issues log for capturing bugs, feature requests and suggestions for MDL</li>
<li>A walkthrough of the MDL Use Case examples explaining and annotating the code.</li>
</ul>
