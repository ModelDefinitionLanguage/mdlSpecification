      <description>Why MDL? Why design a whole new language (MDL) to describe models? The MDL has been designed to allow users to specify models in a consistent language, regardless of the target tool they prefer to use for a given task (e.g. estimation), and regardless of whether they intend to use the model for estimation, simulation, or optimal design. This eliminates the transcoding needed today when using a model in a different tool or for a different purpose.</description>

      <description>Welcome to the DDMoRe Model Description Language (MDL) Community page. This website will provide a resource for anyone wishing to encode models with MDL, will help you understand MDL structure and features and provides a place for you to log bugs, issues, feature requests and suggestions.
What is MDL? MDL is a human writeable and human readable language designed to describe pharmacometric models. It is intended to be largely agnostic about the choice of target tool.</description>
